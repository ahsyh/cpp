This is a testing problem I met with in 2013. The origin problem is:
n: range of number
k: how many number in one sequence
q: how many times player guess
host specify a sequence of number, player try to guess the result. Each time player show a guess, and host give the answer that how many number are correct.
Given a guess list, check whether it is possible.

n k q
9 5 6
6 6 2 7 7 3
2 4 3 8 2 3
3 5 3 2 3 3
7 4 8 4 3 3
5 1 8 4 7 3
3 5 6 8 7 5
